					<h2>Parkhound</h2>
					<blockquote>
						Parkhound is a marketplace that connects drivers looking for parking with local property owners who have spare parking spaces.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						I work closely with co-founders Michael and Rob to help revolutionise the parking industry in Australia. We initially created a friendly <span class="highlight">brand</span> , which instills trust which is always important when dealing with payments.
					</p>
					<p>
						I designed an engaging landing page which serves dual purposes to attract both buyers and sellers in order to help the marketplace succeed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I designed a fully functioning web app which allows users to search for spaces and manage their listings and bookings. The app is designed <span class="highlight">mobile first</span> and is fully <span class="highlight">responsive</span> ensuring that users have a seemless experience no matter what device they are accessing it from.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also designed an <span class="highlight">iPhone app</span> which takes advantage of native features such as location services and push notifications to enhance the experience for our users.
